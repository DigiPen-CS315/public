Automated Testing
-----------------

We will be using the following frameworks for automated tests.

Writing tests is outside the scope of this class, so any tests you write (or don't write) will not be graded.  However, the correctness of your code is graded and testing is a great way to be sure it is correct.  I will integrate the framework into the projects and assignments where it is applicable (it's only a single .hpp file).  I will supply some tests for you to run, but I encourage you to write your own to test your code more thoroughly.
