Books
-----

#### Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective (3rd Edition) by Randal E. Bryant and David R.O'Hallaron
- [[on Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Computer-Systems-Programmers-Perspective-3rd/dp/013409266X) Read if you REALLY want to know how things work. Only the 3rd edition is 64-bit. The International and 2nd editions are 32-bit.

#### The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt
- [[on Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/) One of the best software engineering books I have read. There is an older version too, but this one is newer, better, and cheaper.

### Not applicable for this course but still worth listing:

#### Refactoring by Martin Fowler
- [[on Amazon]](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0134757599/) A great book on refactoring existing code. The code examples are in Java, but the book is almost entirely applicable to other languages.
