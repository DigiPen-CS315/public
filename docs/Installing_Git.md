Installing git
--------------

If you are using Linux, you probably have git installed.  If it is not installed, just run the following command, and skip all of the other steps.

> `sudo apt-get install git`

Then, take a break and wait for the rest of us.

For the rest of us on **Windows:**

Note: This is just the way I set up my git installation on Windows.

Download git from <https://git-scm.com/>.\
Run the git installer and follow these screenshots.

Check whatever you want, this are my selections. We don't need LFS for our projects (at least I hope you don't have source files that large).

I prefer to use VS Code as the default editor, but you can use whatever you are comfortable with and have installed.

I prefer this option to be able to use this installation of git from other tools.

GitHub used to not support Windows Secure Channel, so this has just been the option I've always chosen.

I just prefer one that checks out as-is, so I can use LF instead of CRLF when editing certain files.

I prefer the MinTTY terminal (dedicated bash terminal) as opposed to using the normal cmd.exe Windows console window.

There are reasons and benefits to each of these.  I have just always used rebase on projects.

I normally pick the Git Credential Manager, but I also like trying out new things...

Performance boosts are good.  I'll take them when I can get them.

We won't need this option for our class.

Next, should be install.  Good luck!
